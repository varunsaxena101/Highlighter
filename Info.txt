Plan for frontend extension:
1. There will be a JSON object for each page with two fields:
    - url: (url)
    - highlights: [(list of highlighted strings of text)]
2. After highlighting some text, a popup will appear over the text allowing for highlight
    - If highlight is not wanted, another part of the page is clicked and the popup goes away
    - If the highlight is wanted, the button in the popup is clicked, and the string of text is added
      to the hashset/array
    - The API is then called to update the database

3. After selecting text, bring up context menu with option to highlight
    - later add option to clear/change color of highlight
